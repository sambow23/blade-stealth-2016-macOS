# blade-stealth-2016-macOS
Repo for my Razer Blade Stealth Hackintosh project (WIP)

# This Repo has my Clover EFI folder for anyone trying to run macOS 10.14+ on their Razer Blade Stealth 2016 (Skylake model)
Currently it's WIP and mostly everything working except WIFI (no Broadcom chip), Sleep, and working trackpad gestures (can use touchscreen to scroll, etc)

I won't be actively working on it, but if anyone wants to pick up where I left off, go ahead.

The provided EFI folder should be enough to boot into the macOS installer and a working desktop.
