# This Repo has my Clover EFI folder for anyone trying to run macOS 10.14+ on their Razer Blade Stealth 2016 (Skylake model)
Currently it's WIP and mostly everything working except WIFI (no Broadcom chip), Sleep, Thunderbolt, and any Apple online services (iCloud, App Store, Siri, etc)
I'll update this readme with more information when I get more progress in the future.

The provided EFI folder should be enough to boot into the macOS installer and a working desktop.
